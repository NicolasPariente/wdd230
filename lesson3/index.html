        <h2>Site Name</h2>
        <p>Weather Downpour (weatherdownpour.com) will be the name of the Site. I searched it in "Hostgator" and the domain was available. <br>
            The hosting cost would be $12.95 dollars per year. <br>
            As the page is about the weather but a lot more stuff too, "downpour" adds the idea to the user that he will find a lot of different things on the page about that topic.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
        <p>
        The purpose of the weatherdownpour.com site is to inform people about the weather and it changes, but with a warm welcome
         from our community. To do that the site will also have information of the weather from all over the world, and 
         experiences of the users traveling and meeting new places with different weathers.<br>
         The site will have images and information about how the weather and climate affect the vegetation and wildlife. Our purpose 
         is to offer a complete experience for the users letting them know that weather unites borders.
